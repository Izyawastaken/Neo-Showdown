# Neo Showdown

**Neo Showdown** is a free, open-source browser extension for Pokémon Showdown.  
It adds compatability between the teambuilder and my project Neopaste.

##  Features

- Adds a custom **NeoPaste** export button.
- Converts your live Teambuilder team to clean, shareable links.
- Automatically copies your share link to your clipboard and opens it in a new tab.
- Works 100% client-side — no passwords or extra login needed.
- Adds a open in calculator to open the selected pokemon in showdown calc!
